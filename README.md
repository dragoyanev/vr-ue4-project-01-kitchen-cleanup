# Unreal Engine 4 VR Intro Starter Project READ ME

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Unreal Engine 4 VR Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com)

This project is your first chance to make a game within Unreal Engine 4 for either standing or room-scale VR. You’ll need to utilize motion controllers to build a kitchen-themed interaction game, and you’ll use functions, physics, blueprint communication, and audio to create an immersive experience. Spawn messy dishes and get them into the sink as quickly as possible!
